        <h3>Story 1: The Abandoned (‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ó ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ) Asylum</h3>
        <p>
          On a moonless night, Arjun ventured toward the dilapidated gates of the <span class="vocab">abandoned (‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ó ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> asylum. The air was thick with <span class="vocab">apprehension (‡¶â‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶ó)</span>‚Äîhis heart thudding as though demanding he turn back. Each step crunched on rotten boards, filling the darkness with a bone-chilling <span class="vocab">cacophony (‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶∂ ‡¶∂‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶£)</span> of unseen whispers. He pressed onward, though doubt gnawed at him, a vicious <span class="vocab">anomaly (‡¶Ö‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶≠‡ßÅ‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span> in his courage. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, shadows seemed to <span class="vocab">undulate (‡¶¢‡ßá‡¶â‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶§ ‡¶ì‡¶†‡¶æ)</span> across peeling walls. He felt an icy breeze brush his neck‚Äîone that carried the <span class="vocab">effluvia (‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß)</span> of decay. A lone cell door creaked open, revealing a narrow cot stained with what looked like old blood. The word ‚ÄúHope‚Äù was scrawled on the wall in trembling script, yet a palpable <span class="vocab">rancor (‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span> lingered above it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Arjun fumbled for his flashlight‚Äîhe needed its <span class="vocab">candid (‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ)</span> glow to navigate. Its beam illuminated a row of cells, each more <span class="vocab">desolate (‡¶∂‡ßÇ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø)</span> than the last. From the final cell, a thin figure hovered, half-transparent, and locked eyes with him. Its face contorted into a <span class="vocab">malevolent (‡¶Ö‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≠)</span> grin. In that moment, Arjun‚Äôs blood ran cold. 
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned to flee but the exit had vanished‚Äîwalls now <span class="vocab">coincided (‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ò‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶π‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ)</span> in ways that defied reason, corridors looping back onto themselves. He tried to <span class="vocab">articulate (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßÄ‡¶≤)</span> a scream, but only silence answered. The ghost‚Äôs whisper echoed: ‚ÄúYou cannot <span class="vocab">abandon (‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ó ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> your fate.‚Äù As the lantern died, Arjun realized this asylum was its own judge‚Äîevery escape was only another <span class="vocab">dilemma (‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶æ)</span> to endure.

        <h3>Story 2: The Apex (‡¶ö‡ßÇ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ) of Dread</h3>
        <p>
          Laila had climbed many mountains, but none as foreboding as the <span class="vocab">apex (‡¶ö‡ßÇ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ)</span> of Mount Shivering. When the group discovered a half-buried coffin in the ice, their <span class="vocab">anticipation (‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ)</span> turned to <span class="vocab">dire (‡¶Ü‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶π‡ßÄ‡¶®)</span> dread. The coffin lid was cracked, revealing a skeletal hand clutching a faded journal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As Laila opened the brittle pages, she felt a <span class="vocab">galvanizing (‡¶§‡ßÄ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶§)</span> chill run down her spine. The ink writhed across the paper, as if by its own will‚Äîa <span class="vocab">censorious (‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶ö‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßÇ‡¶≤‡¶ï)</span> voice condemning anyone who dared disturb its slumber. The mountain wind howled, carrying the <span class="vocab">effluvia (‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß)</span> of ancient rot. The trekkers became acutely aware that this was no mere corpse but an <span class="vocab">anomaly (‡¶Ö‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶≠‡ßÅ‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span>‚Äîsomething meant to stay buried.
        </p>
        <p>
          One by one, they felt their courage <span class="vocab">diminish (‡¶π‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∏ ‡¶™‡¶æ)</span> as the shadows around them deepened. Every broken branch and distant howl became a signal of some unseen predator. In a panic, they tried to <span class="vocab">coincide (‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ò‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶π‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ)</span> their retreat path with the wind‚Äôs direction, but the mountain's geography warped beneath their feet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Laila‚Äôs flashlight flickered, casting a <span class="vocab">candid (‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ)</span> beam onto a figure draped in frost, its eyes glowing with <span class="vocab">malevolent (‡¶Ö‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≠)</span> intent. It lunged‚Äîits scream a fractured <span class="vocab">cacophony (‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶∂ ‡¶∂‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶£)</span> that rattled her bones. She bolted downhill, her only thought to <span class="vocab">endure (‡¶∏‡¶π‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> until dawn. But on Mount Shivering, the darkness did not retreat with the sun‚Äîit only grew more <span class="vocab">rancorous (‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§)</span>.

        <h3>Story 3: The Catalyst (‡¶â‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ‡¶™‡¶ï) of Nightmares</h3>
        <p>
          In the backstreets of Dhaka, an old bookstore stood as a <span class="vocab">sanctimonious (‡¶™‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶Æ)</span> fa√ßade for something far darker. The owner, an <span class="vocab">eminent (‡¶â‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶ö ‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®)</span> scholar, had a reputation for being <span class="vocab">censorious (‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶ö‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßÇ‡¶≤‡¶ï)</span> of any book that dared to mention the occult. But rumors swirled of an underground chamber stocked with forbidden tomes‚Äîsome said those volumes were the <span class="vocab">catalyst (‡¶â‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ‡¶™‡¶ï)</span> that awakened an ancient spirit. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Hena, a curious linguistics student, felt a pull she couldn‚Äôt explain. She entered at midnight, her flashlight beam slicing through dusty air thick with <span class="vocab">effluvia (‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß)</span>. The scent of old parchment mingled with decay. Each aisle seemed to twist, as if the shelves themselves had decided to <span class="vocab">coincide (‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ò‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶π‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ)</span> into a labyrinth. Hena‚Äôs resolve wavered‚Äîambivalence (‡¶Ö‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶ö‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶§‡¶æ) gripped her‚Äîbut her thirst for knowledge overpowered her fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the deepest vault, she found a leather-bound book titled ‚ÄúRites of the Unseen.‚Äù The moment she opened it, a <span class="vocab">galvanizing (‡¶§‡ßÄ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶§)</span> pulse reverberated through the floor. Letters on the page shifted like dancing shadows. Hena tried to <span class="vocab">expound (‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ñ‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> her discovery to the owner, but the scholar‚Äôs eyes glowed with <span class="vocab">hubris (‡¶Ö‡¶π‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞)</span>. He declared that by reading aloud, she would become a conduit for something <span class="vocab">malevolent (‡¶Ö‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≠)</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The book‚Äôs final incantation echoed in Hena‚Äôs mind. A chill wind swept through the shop, knocking candles over. The walls themselves seemed to <span class="vocab">undulate (‡¶¢‡ßá‡¶â‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶§ ‡¶ì‡¶†‡¶æ)</span> as if reality was bending. In a desperate bid, Hena tried to <span class="vocab">refute (‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶ï ‡¶ñ‡¶£‡ßç‡¶°‡¶® ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> the text‚Äôs power, but her voice faltered. A silhouette emerged‚Äîa faceless thing that whispered ‚ÄúYour choice was to <span class="vocab">entail (‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¨ ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ñ‡¶æ)</span> what cannot be undone.‚Äù Hena felt herself slipping into madness as the shop‚Äôs door slammed shut, trapping her in a nightmare that had no end.

        <h3>Story 4: The Subtle (‡¶∏‡ßÇ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶Æ) Whispers</h3>
        <p>
          In the old quarter of the city, villagers spoke in hushed tones of a <span class="vocab">sanctimonious (‡¶™‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶Æ)</span> monk who once tried to <span class="vocab">objectify (‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> restless spirits. His arrogance‚Äîor <span class="vocab">hubris (‡¶Ö‡¶π‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞)</span>‚Äîled him to craft a ritual that bound ghosts to his will. Yet, instead of controlling them, he became their eternal prisoner. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who dared approach the ruins of his monastery would hear subtle <span class="vocab">whispers (‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶Å‡¶ï‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßã ‡¶∂‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶)</span> at dusk‚Äîmere breaths of sound, barely audible, but enough to twist the mind. A traveler named Sufi, known for her <span class="vocab">savvy (‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶æ)</span> wit, decided to investigate. She walked among toppled statues and crumbling archways, her footsteps echoing like a <span class="vocab">cacophony (‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶∂ ‡¶∂‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶£)</span> in an abandoned hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          As twilight deepened, Sufi noticed candles flickering around a central courtyard, though no flame was visible. The air grew <span class="vocab">rarefy (‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ)</span>, making each breath a battle. She pressed on toward the altar at the courtyard‚Äôs center, where the monk‚Äôs bones lay eerily arranged in a circle. Suddenly, the chanting began‚Äîsoft, yet laden with <span class="vocab">rancor (‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span>. ‚ÄúThis place is <span class="vocab">unadorned (‡¶∏‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶π‡ßÄ‡¶®)</span> but sacred,‚Äù the voice hissed. ‚ÄúYou will <span class="vocab">endure (‡¶∏‡¶π‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> what you do not understand.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Sufi tried to retreat, but the ground beneath her feet seemed to <span class="vocab">undulate (‡¶¢‡ßá‡¶â‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶§ ‡¶ì‡¶†‡¶æ)</span>, and the shadows elongated into twisting shapes. She felt a spectral hand clamp her shoulder‚Äîcold as <span class="vocab">ice (‡¶¨‡¶∞‡¶´)</span>‚Äîand turned to see emptiness. Only whispers remained, echoing through the stones, promising that some spirits can never be laid to rest‚Äîand those who seek them only become another <span class="vocab">anomaly (‡¶Ö‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶≠‡ßÅ‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span> in the night.

        <h3>Story 5: The Culmination (‡¶ö‡ßÇ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨) of the Unseen</h3>
        <p>
          Naina had always been drawn to old family heirlooms. In her grandparents‚Äô attic, she uncovered a small <span class="vocab">cache (‡¶∏‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶≤‡¶®)</span> of letters sealed in a tin box. The last letter bore a warning: ‚ÄúDo not open after midnight.‚Äù Of course, her <span class="vocab">curiosity (‡¶ï‡ßå‡¶§‡ßÇ‡¶π‡¶≤)</span>‚Äîa trait sometimes called <span class="vocab">immoderate (‡¶Ö‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï)</span>‚Äîdrove her to break the seal as the clock struck twelve. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The letters chronicled a centuries-old pact with an <span class="vocab">omnipotent (‡¶∏‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∂‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®)</span> entity whose name was never spoken aloud. They detailed how a single misstep could <span class="vocab">render (‡¶Ö‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ï‡¶∞)</span> the line between life and death meaningless. As Naina read the final passage, the tin box rattled. A shadow stretched across the room, sharp as a <span class="vocab">quarry (‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶•‡¶∞ ‡¶ñ‡¶®‡¶® ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ)</span> falling from a cliff. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The attic door slammed shut. An unseen force yanked the pages from her hands, and a <span class="vocab">dissonant (‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶∏)</span> chant reverberated through the rafters. Naina‚Äôs candle sputtered out, leaving her in <span class="vocab">stygian (‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º)</span> darkness. A gust of wind blew out any hope of light. As she inched forward, every floorboard creaked, each sound magnified into a <span class="vocab">cacophony (‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶∂ ‡¶∂‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶£)</span> that made her blood run cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the far corner, a mirror hung, though no reflection returned her gaze. Instead, she saw a <span class="vocab">malevolent (‡¶Ö‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≠)</span> version of herself‚Äîeyes black as night, twisted in a grin of <span class="vocab">rancor (‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ)</span>. It whispered one word: ‚ÄúCulmination (‡¶ö‡ßÇ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨).‚Äù The entire attic seemed to shudder, as if the house itself was about to exhale its last breath. Naina stumbled backward, trying to summon strength to <span class="vocab">flee (‡¶™‡¶≤‡¶æ‡ßü‡¶®)</span>. But the mirror‚Äôs surface rippled, and her reflection stepped out‚Äîan <span class="vocab">eidolon (‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶¨)</span> come to claim her soul. In that final moment, she realized that some secrets are meant to remain buried, for when curiosity meets the unseen, the end is always the <span class="vocab">culmination (‡¶ö‡ßÇ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨)</span> of every nightmare.
